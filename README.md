# GKCC - C Compiler for ECE-466 at The Cooper Union

**Note: In order to keep up with a busy school schedule and
still make good progress on this compiler, I have neglected
a lot of good practice such as avoiding bodge fixes and
writing good commit messages. Do as I say and not as I do
:).**

This is the C compiler that I am writing for the ECE-466: Compilers
course at The Cooper Union.

The [course page](https://faculty.cooper.edu/hak/ece466) lists the
assignments and general instructions for the compiler.
